- 2. Support cross rotation of multi singer photo animations
- 3. Audio dynamic spectrum animation
- 4. Basic music player functions (no need to explain, there must be some)
- Note: Low performance or system version may affect runtime performance (with some impact). WIn11 is recommended, as Win11 has special optimizations [doge]

## MoZhiYunStudio: Future feature updates
- 1. identify songs module based on sound fingerprint technology (also open source as a separate project model)
- 2. Guessing Your Favorite Module Based on Big Data User Behavior Analysis
- 3. AI singing module based on nlp, replacing the sound of the song with your own (also open source as a separate project model)
- 4. AI music notation module based on nlp (also open source as a separate project model)
- 5. AI extraction of audio lyrics synchronization information based on nlp (breaking copyright barriers such as Krc and Qrc)
